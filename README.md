# A Guide to Living free of Mind

In order to live free, ensure that your mind is free.

To ensure that your mind is free, make sure you take mind at face value.

If you find yourself convulsing about the next section, please skip down to the [depression](#Depression) section.

## Beliefs

Beliefs and convictions or, simply put, views, form a net of ensnarement for the mind. Once upon a time in India a man understood this fact; you can read all about that [here](https://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html).

There is, however, a way to perceive the world more directly. Clear vision implies, first and foremost, understanding your perceptions as hampered by a cloud of distortions: the eyes see a tiny spectrum of color, the ears hear tiny range of frequencies. And the words we use to convey all this further distort reality, as well as your mind, wich oftentimes uses these very same words to reduce reality to a set of abstract labels.

All this being said, I have a set of very binary beliefs, which might change over time, but help me survive in a world full of people, their views and their opinions.

### I do not believe in hope

Hope is merely the belief in some sort of salvation outside of your control. Better not to hope, but to face the reality of the here and now: try to bear the pain it brings, moreover: try not to mind feeling bad.

### I do not believe in control

Control is dependent on people believing in its existence, as soon as their minds are free, control is lost.

### I do not believe in plans

Plans are a fiction we tell ourselves, they do not respond to the current moment as it is and are therefore totally unnatural. Acting out your plans you will soon discover they never work out according to themselves.

### I believe in spreading unconditional love unconditionally

Whenever you find yourself bored because you stopped making plans, direct your attention towards ways to spread love without desiring anything in return. You can do this in direct contact with people, animals, or anything you see the life of. But you can also do this through well-wishing the image of someone or something in your mind. You can call this Metta-meditation or prayer, or whatever you wish, as long as you do not desire anything in return. It gives me tons of joy.

### I believe in spreading joy unconditionally

Whenever it is hard for you to feel the unconditional love you'd like to spread, see if you can try and spread some joy in stead. Joy is as abundant as love, you can always find access to joy if you look deeply enough.

### I believe in the incurable existence of pain

Pain is one of the easiest sensations to experience directly: life causes you pain as long as your mind is not free of hopes and desires. And let's face it, extremely few people can say that their mind is truly free of those. There is only a limited set of things you _can_ do with your pain: try something to make it go away, accept it, or suffer from it. Have you ever tried _not minding_ the pain you feel? Some pain, especially deep emotional trauma, runs so deep, there is nothing you can do about it. Facing pain is undergoing it and trying not to mind it. A lot of people find this offensive and insensitive, but what else is there that you _can_ do? Keep running away from it or suffering from it for the rest of your life?

### I do NOT believe in inflicting pain

Not inflicting pain to others is easy, at least, not intentionally. 

If you have caused pain to another unintentionally, forgive yourself. If you have caused pain to another _intentionally_, forgive yourself. 

In both cases, try and see whether you can help the other heal. Even though you gave it to them, it is their pain now to deal with. It is not up to you anymore... be listening, be helpful. If you're chased away however, be respectful and let them please deal with their own pain in their own time. And forgive yourself.

Do NOT hurt yourself! Neither by judging yourself, nor physically. You are holy, you are worthy of love and joy, you are an expression of love and joy.


### I believe in forgiveness

If you do not, you live in a painful fiction we tend to call the past for the rest of your life.

### I believe in being grateful

Being grateful directs your attention away from things that make you angry or unhappy... al sorts of negative. If you have even the tiniest inkling of imagination - which we all have in abundance - you can find something to be grateful for _right now_: I just took off my shoes which were tight around my feet!

I mentioned joy always being there for you to access in abundance. Just thinking of the first thing you are grateful for is the key to this infinite well.

### I believe in water

Touching water feels great and water rocks, cause it always seeks the lowest point and erodes away the edges.

### I don't believe I am important

Ever wonder why people who act self-important cause you so much annoyance?

If they make themselves more important, does it not take away from how important _you_ are?

It's as if there is a limited amount of importance to be had in the world and it is quite dubious what you'd want to do with yourself once you are considered important.

There was a time quite a number of people thought I was quite important. Then time passed and they forgot how important I was to them. Whenever I forget that I live in a delusional mind-reality I forget that I'm not important at all... It is one of those relative, opinion-based things that have no real use, except to exert control on your environment with. But exerting control on your environment is a horrible act of violence, denying the fact that minds are free.

Oh well... whenever you catch yourself feeling important, please imagine a cold waterfall on you wearing it all away again.

Oh, and whenever you catch youself feeling unimportant, please be grateful.

## Depression

All these beliefs sound nice and all. But when you're thouroughly depressed they're quite offensive, even depressing to read. 

But depression is the result of self-inflicted violence.

Most depressed people do not see themselves as violent, I noticed... But you _are_. If you ever tell yourself negative things you would never say to anyone you love, then you are _being_ quite violent towards yourself in a way that is completely unfair.

This world is full of violence. It is visible when directed outwardly, but the most prevalently widespread form of violence is the violence which is directed inwardly... If you feel invisible, misunderstood, reflect upon the fact that the violence you are inflicting on yourself is invisible to others. 

They can not simply feel with you all that you suffer, you are hiding it from others.

## Self talk

Whether your self-talk is violent causing you depression, or praising, causing you to have a bloated ego. It is wrong. Labeling reality with self-talk is delusional. 

You cannot just say "stop" to your self-talk. Saying "stop" is talking to yourself.

Thoughts come up like a heart-beat. They do not _mean_ anything, there is no trust-worthy reality in thoughts and visions. 

## Emotions

Before I start going on about emotions, I would like to mention that I realize that the beliefs I shared above are of course merely a perception of reality as well. But when you believe in beliefs and the beliefs are helpful then they can be substitute truths for you on the path of clearing your mind... How else, but throught words, can we learn from each other?

Anyway, emotions are quite a mystery and everything I say about emotions here are beliefs I formed through reading. Science about emotions supports some of these statements, but how did the science measure the emotions? There must have been a subjective component apart from dry observation in order to say anything scientific about emotions. 

Therefore, I, again, take the freedom to use a style of writing which is _truthy_. 

When you take a little leap of faith you can thus see emotions, especially ones which are repressed, find their way into your body. Muscle aches, cramps, slumbering cysts which are a dangerous infection waiting to happen.

Once you start sitting still and observing your mind you might just run into these physical symptoms popping up at suprising places in the body. If you are a serious case, like me, this can even get scary. In my case, the throbbing mass of surpressed anger especially settled in the muscular structure in an around my skull. Anyone can imagine locked jaws from years of clenching teeth making sense, but the years it is taking to resolve/dissolve can be discouraging. It's not (at all) like a few hours of meditation per day is cure for anger either. Every time anger comes back and is repressed, tensions in the body are _re_strained.

The difference is that it is conscious now. Meditation cultivates conciousness. Mindfulness is trying to constantly re_mind_ yourself to be aware of what is happening in your body: what the body feels, what emotions you feel, what thoughts come up.

Buddhism in the traditional sense dissects all these aspects of what happens inside you, in order to cultivate this awareness and refine it. Wise discernment.

If you live with a (predominantly Western) mindset of achievement where you work hard to achieve something, it can be extremely discouraging to take up meditation and practice. You expect to get the results when you work hard. You read things like 'the attainment of the 1st Jhanna' as if it is something you earn. But anything hard is counterproductive, or non-productive at best.

It becomes even more discouraging when you read things like: "only when in Jhanna can you start to carefully apply wise discernment to learn to recognise how things have come to be". 

The result-driven, achievement-oriented way of life misses the point entirely.

But I digress. In dependence on contact, feelings arise. Cultivating awareness, applying wise discernment, does not and _cannot_ cure you from emotions. You have had contact, emotions have arisen, emotions are unresolved and stored deep inside your body. If I had the misunderstanding that I could be cured from emotions, I conjecture some of you readers might have the same misunderstanding. The chain of dependent arising [todo: reference here] is not broken here; contact cannot be avoided. You can learn to allow your emotions to _be_ without acting them out, without suppressing them. Sometimes naming them, while venting a little of the emotional charge is even necessary. 

When I say I believe in pain I mean pain (the root-emotion covering the spectrum including anger, fear, sadnesss and the like) is the primary transformer in freeing your mind from pain. Craving and clinging. This is where the chain is broken. And when you do not crave to be away from your pain, nor cling to the idea that you can be free of this pain it is exactly _then_ when 'transformation' happens. Can you be okay with this horrible feeling of - let's say - being left out? "I don't mind feeling bad"

My skull, apparently, also had cramped muscles behind the eyes, at the top of the palate, directly under the brain... Maybe the energy I sense when all these muscles tense is more real than anatomy allows? I don't know, but I'm open to the idea that there _is_ actually a tumultuous burning hot water current forcing itself _though_ my brain from the back of my spine to my forehead. I'm starting to open up to the idea that there _is_ in fact a spiritual cork just on the middle of my forehead being pressed against by this current continually. 

It may not happen to every frequent meditator, but you can imagine it is all to do with emotions. Words like "blocked energy" and "pain body" spring to mind... But to me it all boils down to a simple sequence:
- you come in contact with something that hurts you (either real in the now, or from an old memory)
- you cannot endure the pain this something causes you
- you try to get away from the pain by either acting out, or (in my case) clenching your teeth
- the pain is stored up ready for you to be confronted with all over again day,s, weeks, months or years later.

I'm still in the leap-of-faith stage, but trying not to be hopeful these physical symptoms will ever end (I don't believe in hope). I'm fine, actually.
