# A Guide to Living free of Mind

In order to live free, ensure that your mind is free.

To ensure that your mind is free, make sure you take mind at face value.

If you find yourself convulsing about the next section, please skip down to the [depression](#Depression) section.

## Beliefs

Beliefs and convictions or, simply put, views, form a net of ensnarement for the mind. Once upon a time in India a man understood this fact; you can read all about that [here](https://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html).

There is, however, a way to perceive the world more directly. Clear vision implies, first and foremost, understanding your perceptions as hampered by a cloud of distortions: the eyes see a tiny spectrum of color, the ears hear tiny range of frequencies. And the words we use to convey all this further distort reality, as well as your mind, wich oftentimes uses these very same words to reduce reality to a set of abstract labels.

All this being said, I have a set of very binary beliefs, which might change over time, but help me survive in a world full of people, their views and their opinions.

### I do not believe in hope

Hope is merely the belief in some sort of salvation outside of your control. Better not to hope, but to face the reality of the here and now: try to bear the pain it brings, moreover: try not to mind feeling bad.

### I do not believe in control

Control is dependent on people believing in its existence, as soon as their minds are free, control is lost.

### I do not believe in plans

Plans are a fiction we tell ourselves, they do not respond to the current moment as it is and are therefore totally unnatural. Acting out your plans you will soon discover they never work out according to themselves.

### I believe in spreading unconditional love unconditionally

Whenever you find yourself bored because you stopped making plans, direct your attention towards ways to spread love without desiring anything in return. You can do this in direct contact with people, animals, or anything you see the life of. But you can also do this through well-wishing the image of someone or something in your mind. You can call this Metta-meditation or prayer, or whatever you wish, as long as you do not desire anything in return. It gives me tons of joy.

### I believe in spreading joy unconditionally

Whenever it is hard for you to feel the unconditional love you'd like to spread, see if you can try and spread some joy in stead. Joy is as abundant as love, you can always find access to joy if you look deeply enough.

### I believe in the incurable existence of pain

Pain is one of the easiest sensations to experience directly: life causes you pain as long as your mind is not free of hopes and desires. And let's face it, extremely few people can say that their mind is truly free of those. There is only a limited set of things you _can_ do with your pain: try something to make it go away, accept it, or suffer from it. Have you ever tried _not minding_ the pain you feel? Some pain, especially deep emotional trauma, runs so deep, there is nothing you can do about it. Facing pain is undergoing it and trying not to mind it. A lot of people find this offensive and insensitive, but what else is there that you _can_ do? Keep running away from it or suffering from it for the rest of your life?

### I do NOT believe in inflicting pain

Not inflicting pain to others is easy, at least, not intentionally. 

If you have caused pain to another unintentionally, forgive yourself. If you have caused pain to another _intentionally_, forgive yourself. 

In both cases, try and see whether you can help the other heal. Even though you gave it to them, it is their pain now to deal with. It is not up to you anymore... be listening, be helpful. If you're chased away however, be respectful and let them please deal with their own pain in their own time. And forgive yourself.

Do NOT hurt yourself! Neither by judging yourself, nor physically. You are holy, you are worthy of love and joy, you are an expression of love and joy.


### I believe in forgiveness

If you do not, you live in a painful fiction we tend to call the past for the rest of your life.

### I believe in being grateful

Being grateful directs your attention away from things that make you angry or unhappy... al sorts of negative. If you have even the tiniest inkling of imagination - which we all have in abundance - you can find something to be grateful for _right now_: I just took off my shoes which were tight around my feet!

I mentioned joy always being there for you to access in abundance. Just thinking of the first thing you are grateful for is the key to this infinite well.

### I believe in water

Touching water feels great and water rocks, cause it always seeks the lowest point and erodes away the edges.

### I don't believe I am important

Ever wonder why people who act self-important cause you so much annoyance?

If they make themselves more important, does it not take away from how important _you_ are?

It's as if there is a limited amount of importance to be had in the world and it is quite dubious what you'd want to do with yourself once you are considered important.

There was a time quite a number of people thought I was quite important. Then time passed and they forgot how important I was to them. Whenever I forget that I live in a delusional mind-reality I forget that I'm not important at all... It is one of those relative, opinion-based things that have no real use, except to exert control on your environment with. But exerting control on your environment is a horrible act of violence, denying the fact that minds are free.

Oh well... whenever you catch yourself feeling important, please imagine a cold waterfall on you wearing it all away again.

Oh, and whenever you catch youself feeling unimportant, please be grateful.

## Depression

All these beliefs sound nice and all. But when you're thouroughly depressed they're quite offensive, even depressing to read. 

But depression is the result of self-inflicted violence.

Most depressed people do not see themselves as violent, I noticed... But you _are_. If you ever tell yourself negative things you would never say to anyone you love, then you are _being_ quite violent towards yourself in a way that is completely unfair.

This world is full of violence. It is visible when directed outwardly, but the most prevalently widespread form of violence is the violence which is directed inwardly... If you feel invisible, misunderstood, reflect upon the fact that the violence you are inflicting on yourself is invisible to others. 

They can not simply feel with you all that you suffer, you are hiding it from others.

## Self talk

Whether your self-talk is violent causing you depression, or praising, causing you to have a bloated ego. It is wrong. Labeling reality with self-talk is delusional. 

You cannot just say "stop" to your self-talk. Saying "stop" is talking to yourself.

Thoughts come up like a heart-beat. They do not _mean_ anything, there is no trust-worthy reality in thoughts and visions.
